This is a first pass at a signpost battery pack.

It will be simple. Several li-ion cells with a protection IC.

I would like to have OV/UV/OT/UT protection.

In the future we may consider adding active temperature
compensation (such as a pcb heater under the batteries),
but this design will not include that feature.
