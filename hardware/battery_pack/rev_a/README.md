This is a first pass at a signpost battery pack.

It will be simple. Several li-ion cells with a protection IC.

I would like to have OV/UV/OT/UT protection.

In the future we may consider adding active temperature
compensation (such as a pcb heater under the batteries),
but this design will not include that feature.

I am planning on using the TIbq77904. This will protect
series li-ion cells. It will not balance them (and could 
therefore not get optimal pack lifetime) but it is a 
relatively simple first pass.
