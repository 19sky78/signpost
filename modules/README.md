Signpost Modules
================

Modules that plug into the signpost to do sensing and other applications.

This directory contains modules developed and supported by Lab11 for the signpost platform:

| Module          | Capabilities
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ambient         | Environmental monitoring. Includes pressure, ambient light, humidity, motion detection, and temperature |
| Arduino         | An Aruduino clone that allows you to load and run arduino sketches and plug in Ardunio shields          |
| Audio Spectrum  | Real-time audio sampling capable of binning by frequency or computing on raw audio data |
| Microwave Radar | Passive motion detection that measure the velocity, proximity, rough size, and material estimation of nearby moving objects |
| RF Spectrum     | A wide band spectrum monitor |
| Spectrum 15.4   | Sweeps and monitors all channels defined in the 802.15.4e, reporting the energy present in each channel |
